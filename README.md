# SensoryNamingSchemes

An organized list of potentially useful collections of names, focusing on sensory descriptions that will be very memorable. Potential uses for name sets include software versions, themes, servers, and pretty much anything that includes a set of something or other that needs some sort of memorable designation.

## Requirements for name sets

- Each name set should follow a cohesive theme: For example, same food group(spices, vegetables, oils), or same category of material(gems, rocks, metals).
- Each name in set should evoke a distinct sensory memory/experience. The word can be a direct refererence to a texture, taste, sound, etc or it can be an object related to a particular sense experience.
- Name sets should not violate existing copyright, trademark, etc and should not be any naming scheme already in use by another project or company.
- If a word is known to be used by another project it should be noted in the document.
- Words in name sets should be at least somewhat familiar to the average person, nothing too obscure should be used.
- Each name within a set should have distinct characteristics that can be divided up into subcategories or ordered by some known quality( see example below)
