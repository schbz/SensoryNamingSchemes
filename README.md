# SensoryNamingSchemes
An organized list of potentially useful collections of names, focusing on sensory descriptions that will be very memorable

##Requirements for name sets
- Each name set should follow a cohesive theme: For example, same food group(spices, vegetables, oils), or same category of material(gems, rocks, metals).
- Each name in set should evoke a distinct sensory memory/experience. The word can be a direct referernce to a texture, taste, sound, etc or it can be an object related to a particular sense experience.
- Name sets can not violate existing copyright, trademark, etc and should not be already in use by another project or company.
- If a word is known to be used by another project it should be noted in the document. 
- Words in namesets should be at least somewhat familiar to the average person, nothing too obscure should be used.
- Names within a set should have distinct characteristics that can be divided up into subcategories or ordered by some known quality( see example below)
